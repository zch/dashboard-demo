When Walt Disney's daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers' \"Mary Poppins,\" he made them a promise-one that he didn't realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disney's plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesn't budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history. Inspired by true events, \"Saving Mr. Banks\" is the extraordinary, untold story of how Disney's classic \"Mary Poppins\" made it to the screen-and the testy relationship that the legendary Walt Disney had with author P.L. Travers that almost derailed it.

If not for the legendary heroics of International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley), all would have been lost. In preparation for the next attack, the highly esteemed Colonel Hyrum Graff (Harrison Ford) and the International Military are training only the best young children to find the future Mazer. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield), a shy, but strategically brilliant boy is pulled out of his school to join the elite. Arriving at Battle School, Ender quickly and easily masters increasingly difficult war games, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender is soon ordained by Graff as the military's next great hope, resulting in his promotion to Command School. Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham, himself, to lead his fellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save the human race. Based on the best-selling, award winning novel, ENDER'S GAME is an epic adventure which stars Asa Butterfield, Hailee Steinfeld, Ben Kingsley, Viola Davis, with Abigail Breslin and Harrison Ford. -- (C) Summit","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/43/11174328_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/43/11174328_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/43/11174328_det.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/43/11174328_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Asa Butterfield","id":"770800323","characters":["Ender Wiggin"]},{"name":"Harrison Ford","id":"162661579","characters":["Colonel Hyrum Graff"]},{"name":"Hailee Steinfeld","id":"771070631","characters":["Petra Arkanian"]},{"name":"Abigail Breslin","id":"162653854","characters":["Valentine Wiggin"]},{"name":"Ben Kingsley","id":"162653703","characters":["Mazer Rackham"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0400403"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/enders-game/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770673035/similar.json"}},{"id":"771315525","title":"Last Vegas","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":105,"critics_consensus":"The cast of Last Vegas keep things amiably watchable, but the film is mostly a mellower Hangover retread for the older set.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-11-01","dvd":"2014-01-28"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":47,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":66},"synopsis":"The ensemble comedy follows four old friends who decide to throw a Las Vegas bachelor party for the only one of them who has remained single.

Phillips and Muse are set on an unstoppable collision course when Muse and his crew target Phillips' unarmed ship; in the ensuing standoff, 145 miles off the Somali coast, both men will find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their control. The film is directed by Academy Award (R) nominee Paul Greengrass, from a screenplay by Billy Ray based upon the book, A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea, by Richard Phillips with Stephan Talty.
